<h1><b> Brief:</b></h1>
Build an app that allows a user to track their spending.
<br>
<h3>MVP:</h3>
The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete.
The user should be able to assign tags to a transaction, as well as an amount spent on each transaction.
<br>
The app should display all the transactions a user has made in a single view.
<br>
I took this brief and applied this to real life, working in pensions I can see the gap in the market for pensions and how they are tracked.
<br>
<h1><b>Problem Statement</b></h1>
"I believe there are people who want an online application that they can use to track their pensions collected over the years."
